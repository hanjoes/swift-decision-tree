# Motivation

Swift ML support is on the horizon (checkout [Swift TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift), [swift-jupyter](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter)). Although swift is still in it's primitive stage, the possibility of utilizing a fast, modern programming language in machine learning is fascinating. 

This project will help me re-learn Swift by implementing this well-known statistical model which is also the building block for the versatile [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) learning algorithm.

# Goals
In this project, I want to achieve several goals:

- [x] Implement [Decision Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) learning using [CART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics#Classification_and_regression_trees_.28CART.29).
- [x] Evaluate performance of the implementation on several datasets.
- [ ] Demonstrate how to use [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) along with Swift kernel by leveraging the [swift-jupyter](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter) project.
