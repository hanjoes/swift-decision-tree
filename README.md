# Motivation

Using Swift along with JupyterLab seems one of the sweetest thing I can think of (besides [KrispyKremeDonuts](https://www.krispykreme.com/)). This project will help me re-learn Swift by implementing this well-known machine learning algorithm which is also the building block for the versatile [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) learning algorithm.

# Goals
In this project, I want to achieve several goals:

- [ ] Implement [Decision Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) learning using [CART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics#Classification_and_regression_trees_.28CART.29).
- [ ] Evaluate performance of this algorithm.
- [ ] Demonstrate how to use [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) along with Swift kernel by leveraging the [swift-jupyter](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter) project.
